{/opt,/var/lib,/var/run,/var/log}/socialflow/$env/$application
init.d
/opt - Software
/var/log - Logs
/var/lib - data ( dbs, etc )
/var/run - temporary state data ( pid files, etc )
Idempotency

Self Documenting / Data-Driven ( YAML Configs for easy introspection )
Task Automation ( vs say, puppet's server client architecture running as sudo. )
